[V] Understand why the lattice nÂ°3 is represented differently from number 1 and number 2
[V] Optimal scanning with sub unions
[V] Union with backgrounds
[V] Hit-or-miss/jaccard for colored grid to have node distance
[] Creation of a "Output" space and "Input" space with a way to project the input to the output
Idea -> Things should be as closed to the identity as possible
[X] make unions even more compressed with sets of programs and sets of params
[] resolve the repeat issue : (Var)*{3}(0) == (0)*{Var}(3)
[V] Have a codes and a codes_shifted druign symbolization, as code_shifted should be used to write unions

[V] See issue with problem 1: why not s6?

->> Avoid over_symbolization, maybe symbols shoukld not be able to have bisymbols as params
som symbolization add nothing it leads to this: s_3  < { s_21 } ->  s_3  < { s_21 }
Or maybe it's ok with the right program distance

[] to find the programs of the union: jaccard dist to the previously learned invariants?
For problem 1
Unshifted input: { s_17((1, 5)) } -> { s_17((1, 1)) }U{ s_6((0, 0)) }
Shifted input: { s_17((0, 0)) } -> { s_17((1, 1)) }U{ s_6((0, 0)) }

also issue for problem 2:
For problem 2
Unshifted input: { s_9({8}) } -> { s_9({8}) }U{ s_1({3}) }
Shifted input: {{8}->(0, 0):None} -> { s_9({8}) }U{ s_1({3}) }

#### AIM: Get JACCARD to 0
Note it's an heuristic / distance measure because it's the latent program that needs alignement
